This is an example of a Spring Cloud Stream processor using Kafka Streams support.

This sample demonstrates the concept of interactive queries in kafka streams.
There is a REST service provided as part of the application that can be used to query the store interactively.

Running the app:

We will run 2 instances of the processor application to demonstrate that regardless of which instance hosts the keys, the REST endpoint will serve the requests.
For more information on how this is done, please take a look at the application code.

1. `java -jar target/kafka-streams-interactive-query-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=9000 --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.application.server=localhost:9000

2. On another terminal session:

`java -jar target/kafka-streams-interactive-query-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=9092 --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.application.server=localhost:9092

5. Run the stand-alone `EventGenerator` application to generate data and start the processing.
Keep it running for a while.

6. Go to the URL: https://localhost:9000/trends/top-posts?category=all
keep refreshing the URL and you will see the media post engagement activities count information changes.

Take a look at the console sessions for the applications and you will see that it may not be the processor started on 9000 that serves this request.

7. Go to the URL: https://localhost:9092/trends/top-posts?category=all

Take a look at the console sessions for the applications and you will see that it may not be the processor started on 9092 that serves this request.
